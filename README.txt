This is the repository for the Apache Hadoop Development Tools project, currently a podling at the Apache incubator.

http://hdt.incubator.apache.org/

The source was originally imported by;

git svn clone http://svn.apache.org/hadoop/common/tags/release-0.23.4/hadoop-mapreduce-project/src/contrib/eclipse-plugin/

This clone did not bring the history with it from the svn repo, so to see the history of these files, you will need to refer to Hadoop's svn repository.
